			<p>The Peking Restaurant is a traditional chinese restaurant in Gravesend.</p>
			<p>Their old website is a virtually purposeless template website that does not do the restaurant any justice.</p>
			<p>We are creating them a basic but professional website to showcase the restaurant with menus, prices and photos taken by us.</p>

				<p>The Peking Restaurant is very satistified with what Precise Pixels have done and we are very happy with the price. I would definately recommend their work to other businesses.</p>
