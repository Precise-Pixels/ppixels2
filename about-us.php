			<h2>Background</h2>
			<h3>We are all at the University of Kent studying Multimedia Technology and Design.</h3>
			<p>For our Interaction Design module, we were put into groups of 4 to re-design an existing website. During this project, the two of us realised that we worked extremely well together. At the end of the project, we were approached by the lecturer who was so impressed by our project that she offered to put us in contact with some paid work!</p>
